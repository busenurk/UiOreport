\section{Data Summary}\label{data-summary}}

\textbf{Garbage in, garbage out!}

The most important thing is to understand what is the data structure, in
this manner we need to ask a lot of questions to the data set.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Is the data properly defined?
\item
  Are there any outliers and missing observations?
\end{itemize}

The data set has 12590 observations and 20 variables. All variables are
entered as numeric variables.

\begin{verbatim}
## 'data.frame':    12590 obs. of  20 variables:

Factor variables are fixed for the reliable analysis. Also, the data set
has possible outliers and missing values that have to be examined.

\hypertarget{outliers}{%
\subsection{Outliers}\label{outliers}}

Outliers can have many causes, such as: measurement or input error,
missing values, true outlier observation. There is no precise way to
define and identify outliers in general because of the specifics of each
dataset. Instead, researcher and an expert, must interpret the raw
observations and decide whether a value is an outlier or not. The data
set examined as univariate and multivariate perspective in order to
create a road map.

\hypertarget{univariate-outlier-evaluation}{%
\subsubsection{Univariate Outlier
Evaluation}\label{univariate-outlier-evaluation}}

Univariate outlier check is done with boxplot. It is seen that each
variable has outliers both upper and lower level. (\emph{This is an
interactive plot, you can add or exclude variables in a one click on
variable label, and you can see the points and thresholds on the plot})

\includegraphics{analyse_report_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-5-1.pdf}

The outliers are examined. An observation can be observed as an outlier
in more than one variable. For this reason, the intersection must be
checked (7 intersecting observations were counted only once). Total
number of outliers are equal to 458, 23 of these observations belong to
the vaccinated observations. 435 of these observations belong to the
non-vaccinated observations.

At this point, the important question is \textbf{what is the rate of
vaccinated and non-vaccinated observations in the data?} The data set
has 207 vaccinated, and 12383 non-vaccinated observations. When we
compare each group within itself, it is seen that, in case of removing
outliers from the data set, 3.64\% of total observations are lost.
Although this rate is small, it is a significant loss because the rate
also equal to 11.11\% of vaccinated and 3.51\% of non-vaccinated
observations.

\hypertarget{multivariate-outlier-evaluation}{%
\subsubsection{Multivariate Outlier
Evaluation}\label{multivariate-outlier-evaluation}}

Multivariate outlier check is done by using spatial signs which is fast
algorithm for identifying multivariate outliers in high-dimensional
and/or large data sets. The computation of the distances is based on
Mahalanobis distances.

The data set has 295 possible outliers from multivariate perspective.
When we compare each group within itself, it is seen that, in case of
removing outliers from the data set, \%2.34 of total observations are
lost. They are equal to 1.45\% of vaccinated and 2.36\% of
non-vaccinated observations.

\hypertarget{decision}{%
\subsubsection{🎯 Decision}\label{decision}}

\textbf{The decision of which outliers to be eliminated should be made
together with the domain expert.} In this case study, the intersection
of outliers that is both univariate and multivariate possible outlier
set are selected as final outliers.

In the final case, 14 of outliers are eliminated which belong to
non-vaccinated observations.

\hypertarget{missing-values}{%
\subsection{Missing Values}\label{missing-values}}

After the outlier elimination, the missing values should be checked and
examined. It can be seen that, \(98.25\%\) of gestational week of
vaccination observation is missing. This rate also equal to the number
of non-vaccinated observations. As expected, a non-vaccinated
observation does not have a vaccination week information. For this
reason, gestational week of vaccination variable is excluded from the
data set before imputation.

\begin{wraptable}{r}{0pt}
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|r}
\hline
  & Missing Value(\%)\\
\hline
gestationalweekofvaccination & 98.2446386\\
\hline
depression\_severity & 0.5798253\\
\hline
smoking & 1.0722796\\
\hline
bmipp & 0.1191422\\
\hline
education & 0.2779984\\
\hline
gestage & 0.4289118\\
\hline
\end{tabular}\end{wraptable}

Under the assumption that data were missing at random (MAR), the missing
values are imputed. For imputation, Generates Multivariate Imputations
by Chained Equations (MICE) package is used that creates multiple
imputations for multivariate missing data. The method is based on Fully
Conditional Specification, where each incomplete variable is imputed by
a separate model. In this study, m is selected as 5 because the
substantive conclusions are unlikely to change as a result of raising m
beyond \(m=5\) (Van Buuren 2018).

In the beginning of imputation step, the data set is splitted into two
group which are vaccinated and non-vaccinated because of interactions.
Each group is imputed and then combined the imputed data sets (Van
Buuren 2018).

After the normality test, Bayesian linear regression is used for bmipp
and birthweight variables which are normally distributed. Predictive
mean matching is used for other variables for multiple imputation.

\begin{verbatim}
##               Test            Variable Statistic   p value Normality
## 1 Anderson-Darling depression_severity    5.9816  <0.001      NO

## 3 Anderson-Darling         age            1.4548   9e-04      NO    
## 4 Anderson-Darling     birthweight        0.3083   0.56       YES   
## 5 Anderson-Darling       gestage          5.7090  <0.001      NO
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{decision-1}{%
\subsubsection{🎯 Decision}\label{decision-1}}

Except for the gestational week of vaccination variable, all missing
observations are imputed.

\hypertarget{data-modifications}{%
\subsection{Data Modifications}\label{data-modifications}}

In this study, the association between vaccine and small gestational age
at birth is examined. For this purpose, some of variables are converted
for usage and some new variables are created.

At this point, gestage (in days) values are converted from day to week.

\hypertarget{gestatinal-week-of-vaccination}{%
\subsubsection{Gestatinal Week of
Vaccination}\label{gestatinal-week-of-vaccination}}

As mentioned before, gestational week of vaccination variable has a lot
of missing value because the data set has a lot of non-vaccinated
observations. In order to use this important variable in the analysis
both vaccinated and non-vaccinated group, the continuous variable
converted to factor variable by using trimesters. This transformation
also provides ease of interpretation.

\begin{tabular}[t]{r|l|l}
\hline
value & trimesters & meaning\\
\hline
0 & NA & No vaccination\\
\hline
1 & 0 - 13 weeks & vaccination in 1st trimester\\
\hline
2 & 14 - 26 weeks & vaccination in 2nd trimester\\
\hline
3 & 27 - 40 weeks & vaccination in 3rd trimester\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\hypertarget{determination-of-smallshort-gestational-age-sga}{%
\subsubsection{Determination of Small/Short Gestational Age
(SGA)}\label{determination-of-smallshort-gestational-age-sga}}

Small for gestational age (SGA) newborns are those who are smaller in
size than normal for the gestational age, most commonly defined as a
weight below the 10th percentile (threshold) for the gestational age
(MedlinePlus). In this study, SGA determination is done with the
proposed table (Talge et al. 2014). Thus, a new factor variable
gestatinal.age (\(SGA = 1\), \(AGA = 0\)) is generated using the
birthweight and gestage variables. Also, the variable gestage (in days)
is converted to week format for computational convenience.

\begin{verbatim}
## # A tibble: 23 x 2

\hypertarget{method}{%
\section{Method}\label{method}}

It is seen that, the vaccination variable has unbalanced groups as
vaccinated and non-vaccinated. For this reason, inverse probability of
treatment weighting (IPTW) is used to balance groups using a propensity
score matching weight approach.

The association between vaccine and small gestational age at birth is
examined with logistic regression because the gestational.age variable
is binary. In this manner, gestatinal.age and vaccination variables are
considered as response and explanatory variables, respectively. The
logistic regression is applied both before and after IPTW for comparison
purpose.

\hypertarget{the-summary-of-variables-beforeafter-inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighting-iptw}{%
\subsection{The Summary of Variables Before/After Inverse Probability of
Treatment Weighting
(IPTW)}\label{the-summary-of-variables-beforeafter-inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighting-iptw}}

In the IPTW method, the propensity score is defined as the probability
of being vaccinated. It is obtained from a logistic regression model
where the vaccination variable is considered as a binary dependent
variable and the following list of covariates is considered as the
independent variables.

\begin{verbatim}
##  [1] "ibu_prepreg"         "paracet_prepreg"     "opioid_prepreg"     
##  [4] "diabetes"            "depression_severity" "pain"               
##  [7] "headache"            "pelvicgirdlepain"    "smoking"            
## [10] "bmipp"               "age"                 "parity"             
## [13] "education"           "malform"             "sarscov2_infection"
\end{verbatim}

Balance before and after IPTW assessed using the standardized mean
difference (SMD) between vaccination groups. A SMD of greater that 0.1
is usually considered to indicate a significant imbalance(Austin 2009).

After the missing data imputation, 5 imputed data sets are obtained. In
the next, firstly, we present results for the first imputation data sets
(\(m = 1\)). Then, the combination of all imputed data set results are
presented.

Unweighted distribution of baseline characteristics of the study
population for \(m=1\).

Family-based studies showed that gestational age at birth is partially
(from 25\% to 40\%) determined by genetic factors (Clausson,
Lichtenstein, and Cnattingius 2000).

The ratio between fetal growth rate and uterine size (reflecting uterine
distension) is suspected to partially determine the pregnancy length
(Bacelis et al. 2018).
